### Problem 
Many times we have witnessed that the money issued by the government is often misused.
It hardly reaches its destination. The government transfers money to the intermediaries to
complete the task but no one knows where that money is finally used. Most of the times it
ends up in officials personal account as black money.
We have also seen that many times when a citizen go for completion of their work, the
officials demand bribe to do that task. This also adds up in the total corruption in the
country.
So our idea will eradicate these two problems of money laundering and bribery.

### SOLUTION:
In the current age, there is corruption in every government sector. The problem persists not
only in India but it has become a major global issue. Till now there was no particular method
that guaranteed to tackle this problem. But now after the introduction of Blockchain
technology in the world, the problem seems to get solved. For the first time, we may actually
have a viable solution to rampant political and economic corruption in the world.
Blockchain has two distinctive features that make it a potent tool against corruption. First, it
provides an unprecedented level of security of the information and the integrity of records it
manages, guaranteeing their authenticity. It eliminates opportunities for falsification and
the risks associated with having a single point of failure in the management of data.
Second, blockchain provides a transparent and decentralised system to record a sequence
of transactions, or “blocks”. Blockchain creates an immutable trail of transactions, allowing
for the full traceability of every transaction.
Blockchain is particularly suited to fight corruption in the registry of assets and the tracking
of transactions such as procurement processes. By leveraging a shared and distributed
database of ledgers, it eliminates the need for intermediaries, cutting red-tape and reducing
discretionality.
